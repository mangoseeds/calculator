The calculator includes:

iOS 13 styled buttons
Basic operators: '+ - * / =
Chained operations
Clear button to reset
Backspace button to delete

**Running the Calculator**
To use the web calculator:

Press C to clear the calculator and start over

**Technologies Used**
This project was built with:

This project was done while following the Web Development course by Brian Holt from FrontEnd Masters. You can find it here https://btholt.github.io/complete-intro-to-web-dev-v3/.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions or improvements for this web calculator project! I'm still learning and hope to make better and more complex web apps by building on these fundamental skills.
